# Computational Experiments for *Dual-Driven Path Elimination for Vehicle Routing with Idle Times and Arrival-Time Consistency*

This repository contains all input and output files associated with the computational experiments described in the article:

> *Dual-Driven Path Elimination for Vehicle Routing with Idle Times and Arrival-Time Consistency*

## Computational Environment

All algorithms were implemented in C++ and compiled with `gcc` version **13.3.0** on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**, using the `-O2` optimization flag. Experiments were executed on a **single core** of an **Intel Core i5-7500** processor with **20 GB RAM**.

The **CPLEX 22.1** solver (via its callable library) was used to solve the branch-and-cut implementations. A **time limit of 7200 seconds** was imposed for each instance, replicating the computational setup adopted in:

> *A Decomposition Algorithm for the Consistent Traveling Salesman Problem with Vehicle Idling*,  
> Anirudh Subramanyam and Chrysanthos E. Gounaris, *Transportation Science* (2018), 52(2), 386–401.

### `input/`

- **`Initial feasible solutions/`**: Contains solutions generated by the initial heuristic proposed in this work.
- **`Subramanyan & Gounaris/`**: Includes ConTSP input files retrieved from [this dataset](http://gounaris.cheme.cmu.edu/datasets/contsp/).

### `output/`

Results are organized by formulation type:

- **`Compact/`**: Results for the baseline compact formulation (414 instances from the first 23 families).
- **`SEC-Enhanced/`**: Results using the compact formulation enhanced with connectivity cuts (756 instances).
- **`Path-Elimination/`**: Results using the proposed path elimination model with infeasibility-driven cuts (756 instances).

Each folder contains:
- A `.csv` summary of performance per instance.
- A `log/` subfolder with the CPLEX log for each run.
- A `sol/` subfolder with detailed solution files.
