# Computational Experiments for *Dual-Driven Path Elimination for Vehicle Routing with Idle Times and Arrival-Time Consistency*

This repository contains the input and output files associated with the computational experiments described in the article *Dual-Driven Path Elimination for Vehicle Routing with Idle Times and Arrival-Time Consistency*.

## Repository Structure

### `input/`

This folder contains two subdirectories:

* **`Initial feasible solutions/`**: Includes feasible solutions generated by the initial heuristic proposed in this work.
* **`Subramanyan & Gounaris/`**: Contains ConTSP input files retrieved from [http://gounaris.cheme.cmu.edu/datasets/contsp/](http://gounaris.cheme.cmu.edu/datasets/contsp/).

### `output/`

This folder is organized into three subdirectories:

* **`Compact/`**: Stores output from the algorithm based on the compact formulation. Results are provided for the first 414 instances (corresponding to the first 23 families).
* **`SEC-Enhanced/`**: Stores output from the algorithm based on the compact formulation enhanced with connectivity cuts. Results are available for all 756 instances (across 42 families).
* **`Path-Elimination/`**: Stores output from the proposed path elimination model with infeasibility-driven cuts. Results are also available for all 756 instances.

Each of these folders includes a `.csv` file containing detailed results for all tested instances. For each instance, the following columns are reported:

### Instance Details

* **Instance name**: Identifier of the instance.
* **maxTimeWidth (\$\omega\_c\$)**: Maximum allowable time window width for any customer.
* **maxRouteTime (\$\omega\_0\$)**: Maximum total duration allowed for any route.
* **# service days**: Number of service days required.
* **# customers**: Total number of customers.
* **# operations**: Total number of service operations.
* **Opt./Best no waiting**: Best known solution value (without waiting) reported by Subramanyan and Gounaris.
* **Opt./Best waiting**: Best known solution value (with waiting) reported by Subramanyan and Gounaris.
* **Problem type**: Type of ConTSP variant.

### Solution Method Details

* **Algorithm**: Name of the algorithm used.
* **# cons** / **# var**: Number of constraints and variables in the formulation.
* **Root time (sec.)**: Time to solve the LP relaxation at the root node.
* **Total time (sec.)**: Total CPU time used to solve the instance.
* **SEC r\_time / time (sec.)**: Time spent generating and applying connectivity (SEC) cuts at the root and during the full run.
* **PEC r\_time / time (sec.)**: Time spent generating and applying path elimination (PEC) cuts at the root and during the full run.
* **#BB r\_iterations**: Number of branching iterations at the root.
* **#BC iterations / nodes**: Total number of branch-and-cut iterations and explored nodes.
* **#Connect r\_cuts / cuts**: Number of connectivity cuts added at the root and during the full run.
* **#PEC r\_cuts / cuts**: Number of path elimination cuts added at the root and during the full run.
* **Root LB / UB**: Lower and upper bounds at the root node.
* **Best Bound / Best Integer**: Final best bound and best integer solution found.
* **Status**: Termination status of the solution process (e.g., optimal, time limit, memory limit).

Additionally, for each instance family:

* The **`log/`** subfolder contains CPLEX log files generated during the solution process for each individual instance.
* The **`sol/`** subfolder contains the corresponding solution files for each instance.
